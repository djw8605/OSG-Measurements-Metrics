<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>How do I read these legends?</b>
<p>  Because there are sometimes many bars to include (and having too many 
colors can make distinguishing colors difficult), we do allow the graphs to 
repeat colors.  However, the ordering of the stacked bars is from "biggest" 
to "smallest".  The VO or facility with the most usage is at the top of the 
stack; in the legend, they are the entry in the upper left.  The rest of the 
legend follows the bars in the stack from left to right along the row.

So, the VO/facility with the smallest usage, at the very bottom of the stack
in the graph, should be on the lower right.

<li><b>Where can I find more information about the VOs?</b>
<p>
The GOC maintains the authoritative registration information for each VO.
Their webpage can be found here: <a href="https://oim.grid.iu.edu/pub/vo/show.php">https://oim.grid.iu.edu/pub/vo/show.php</a>.
