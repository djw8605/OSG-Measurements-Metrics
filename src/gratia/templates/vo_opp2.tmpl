<h3>What is Opportunistic Usage?</h3>
<p>
Loosely, opportunistic usage is computational hours done on hardware not owned
by the organization using it; it is work done by the VO which would not have
been possible without the use of the grid.
</p>
<p>
While the idea sounds simple, opportunistic usage is difficult to measure
because of partial ownership of the site; a site's hardware might be owned by
multiple VOs, and what usage is considered "opportunistic" varies greatly by
local policy which is out of the grid's control
</p>
<p>
For this page, we consider a VO's job "opportunistic" if it is run at a site
where the VO owns no resources at all; if a VO is running at a site where it
owns any of the hardware, we call that usage "owned".  In this way, we can be
ensured that, in a worst-case-scenario, we are under-reporting opportunistic
usage and never over-reporting it.
